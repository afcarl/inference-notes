# Inference & machine learning notes

These are short notes on statistical inference and machine
learning concepts:

1.  `probability`: a review of basic probability with a few worked-out examples.

2.  `hmms`: a brief introduction to Hidden Markov Models and the
    forward-backward algorithm, with a fully worked-out example.

3.  `ising-gibbs`: a brief introduction to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
    methods, including Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling. Also covers
    the Ising model, commonly used in applications like computer vision.

4.  `gmm-em`: a brief introduction to Gaussian mixture models (useful for
    modeling continuous data from several different groups) and the EM
    algorithm.

You can find the notes themselves at [my website](http://people.csail.mit.edu/rameshvs/).

## Compiling

Run `make` from the top directory to compile everything, or to
compile an individual document, e.g., hmms, run `make hmms`.
